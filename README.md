# N-Body Simulation with Fast Multipole Method and Verlet Integration
This project visualises the N-body problem, specifically the motion of heavy classical particles, using the Fast Multipole Method and the Verlet integration method.

## Features
- Simulation of many-body dynamics in a 2D box with boundary reflections.
- Implementation of the Fast Multipole Method for efficient force calculation.
- Verlet integration scheme for stable and accurate trajectory computation.
- Animated visualization of particle motion with `matplotlib`.

## Usage
Run the script to generate and save an animation (`N-bodies.gif`) of particle dynamics:

```bash
python main.py
